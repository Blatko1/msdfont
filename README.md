# **msdfont-rs**

* **WIP**

**Multi-channel signed distance field** (MSDF) generator for fonts implemented in pure Rust.

This crate will become a public library when the *SDF generation* and **pseudo-SDF** become **fully stable and starts working**.
Later **MSDF** and **MTSDF** will be implemented.

This project wouldn't exist without *Chlumskys* **[msdfgen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen)** and other Rust libraries which implement his algorithm.

## TODO

- [ ] Fix: *Overlapping Contours* Correction
- [ ] Add support for **Cubic BÃ©zier Curves**
- [ ] Implement MSDF generation for fonts
- [ ] Implement MTSDF generation for fonts
- [ ] Add more showcase items
- [ ] Add a proper example
- **...more to be added...**
- [ ] Construct a complete user-friendly library

## Features

* SDF, pseudo-SDF generation for fonts
