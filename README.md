* **WIP**

**Multi-channel signed distance field** (MSDF) generator for fonts implemented in pure Rust.

This crate will become a public library when the *SDF generation* and **pseudo-SDF** become **fully stable and starts working**.
Later **MSDF** and **MTSDF** will be implemented.

This project wouldn't exist without *Chlumskys* **[msdfgen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen)** and other Rust libraries which implement his algorithm.

## TODO üìù

* [x] Add a tool for creating custom shapes
* [ ] Fix: Simple *Overlapping Contours* Correction - *WIP*
* [ ] Improve *Overlapping Contours* Correction to *perfection* - *WIP*
* [ ] Add a function for checking intersections for quadratic and cubic functions
* [ ] Add support for **Cubic B√©zier Curves**
* [ ] Implement MSDF generation for fonts
* [ ] Implement MTSDF generation for fonts
* [ ] Add more showcase items
* [ ] Add a proper example
* **...rest of TODOs is in code...**
* [ ] Better organization of code
* [ ] Construct a complete user-friendly library
