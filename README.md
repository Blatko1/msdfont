# **msdfont-rs**

* **WIP**

Multi-channel signed distance field (MSDF) generator for fonts implemented in pure Rust.

This crate will become a public library when *SDF generation* becomes **fully stabile and starts working**.
Later **pseudo-SDF**, **MSDF** and **MTSDF** will be implemented.

This project wouldn't exist without *Chlumskys* **[msdfgen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen)** and other Rust libraries which implement his algorithm.

## Example of SDF
