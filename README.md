> **WIP** - Developer currently suffering because glyphs with overlapping contours exist. (but not for long!)

**Multi-channel signed distance field** (`M`[`SDF`](https://prideout.net/blog/distance_fields/)) generator for fonts implemented in pure Rust.

This crate will soon become a public library. Later **MSDF** and **MTSDF** will be implemented.

This project wouldn't exist without *Chlumsky's* **[`msdfgen`](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen)** and other Rust libraries which implement his algorithm.

## TODO :memo:

* [x] Add a tool for creating custom shapes
* [ ] Fix: Simple *Overlapping Contours* Correction - ***WIP***
*  Add a proper example - ***WIP***
* [ ] Improve *Overlapping Contours* Correction to *perfection*
* [ ] Add a function for checking intersections for quadratic and cubic functions
* [ ] Add support for **Cubic BÃ©zier Curves**
* [ ] Implement MSDF generation for fonts
* [ ] Implement MTSDF generation for fonts
* [ ] Add more showcase items
* **rest of the TODOs is in code...**
* [ ] Better organization of code
* [ ] Construct a completely user-friendly library
